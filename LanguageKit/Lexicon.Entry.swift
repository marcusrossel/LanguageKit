    /// expression in a dictionary. It consists of:

    /// - some `context`, which can be used to describe something about the
    /// `expression`.

    /// rather implicitly in its `expression` and `translations`. This method is
    /// viable, as these properties can never change their `Language` once set.

    /// multi-word expressions can be translated as one word in other languages,
